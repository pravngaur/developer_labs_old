# README #
This repository contains example page types and component types for Salesforce B2C Commerce Page Designer. The example page types include a fixed layout page type and an open layout page type. The example component types include a product tile, headline banner, category tile, and several different layouts. This repository also includes data that you can import to your site. The data includes samples of pages assembled using the example page types and component types including a fixed layout page, an open layout page, and a text heavy help page that is discoverable from the search function.

The examples in this repository are intended as a starting point for developing your own custom page types and component types.

The repository contains the following cartridges:

* `module_pagedesigner`: Custom cartridge for the storefront site, including the example page type and component type files.
* `bm_pagedesigner`:  Custom cartridge for the Business Manager site, including properties files for localization and thumbnail images for the UI. 
* `app_pagedesigner_sg`: Overlay cartridge for [SiteGenesis](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sitegenesis) (SG)
* `plugin_pagedesigner_sfra`: Overlay cartridge for [Storefront Reference Architecture](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/storefront-reference-architecture/) (SFRA)

## Prerequisites

To enable Page Designer, in Business Manager:

1. Select Administration > Global Preferences > Feature Switches. 
2. Enable Page Designer beta.
3. Read and agree to the terms.
4. Click Apply.

After Page Designer is enabled, select Merchant Tools > Content > Page Designer to see the visual editor.


## Getting Started
### Install Cartridges

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Upload `module_pagedesigner` and `bm_pagedesigner` to your sandbox. 
3. If your site is based on SiteGenesis, upload `app_pagedesigner_sg` to your sandbox. If your site is based on SFRA, upload `plugin_pagedesigner_sfra` to your sandbox.
4. Add `bm_pagedesigner` to the cartridge path of the Business Manager site.
5. Add `module_pagedesigner` to the end of the cartridge path for your storefront site.
6. For SiteGenesis sites, add `app_pagedesigner_sg` to the front of the cartridge path for the storefront site. For SFRA sites, add `plugin_pagedesigner_sfra` to the front of the cartridge path for the storefront site.

For a SiteGenesis site, the cartridge path would look like this:
`app_pagedesigner_sg:sitegenesis_storefront_controllers:sitegenesis_storefront_core:module_pagedesigner`

For an SFRA site, the cartridge path would look like this:

`plugin_pagedesigner_sfra:app_storefront_base:module_pagedesigner`


### Import Data
Use the Site Import feature in Business Manager to upload and import the sample data from the `site-template` directory of the repository. 

For SiteGenesis sites, zip up the `site_template_sitegenesis` directory or use the `site_template_sitegenesis.zip` file.

For SFRA sites, zip up the `site_template_sfra` directory or use the `site_template_sfra.zip` file.

You're now ready to start using Page Designer! 
In Business Manager, select Merchant Tools > Content > Page Designer to see the example page types, component types, and sample pages
from the cartridges that you uploaded.

## Localization
The `bm_pagedesigner` 
cartridge contains properties files that you can submit to be localized for the example page types, component types, 
and component type groups.   
When you add your own page types and component types, or if you modify the examples, you will need to 
update the properties files accordingly.
